I'm a designer at a small digital agency in Edinburgh, where I help to create websites. I studied Interaction Design at art school, using coding, robotics and other tech to create art installations. I'm interested in the overlap between coding and creativity, and I particularly enjoy making games, websites and interactive experiences!
