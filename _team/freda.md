Hello, I’m Freda and I am a trustee of Prewired. I am a visual theatre maker and puppeteer and make stories about 'ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances'. I am a social activist interested in community development, the ownership and management of greenspaces by local people, and the education and wellbeing of children and young people. 

I have a dog called Branwen, a Belgian Shepherd, and she is training me at the moment. I like travel (collecting World Heritage Sites), gardening and riding my motorbike.
