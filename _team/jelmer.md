Hi, I’m Jelmer. I like building stuff, whether that’s with lego or with code. I enjoy things to do with knowledge. For example making computers think, or at least understand us humans better. Or present knowledge in such a way that it’s easy for us to understand (and fun to look at). I live off universities.
