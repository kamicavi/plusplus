Hello, I’m Gina! I am the Project Coordinator for the Emporium of Digital Delights. I love the digital arts, with a background in performing arts, and I enjoy being creative both onstage and on camera. 

In my spare time, I like to rock climb, sail, climb hills, canoe, run long distances, go cold water swimming, play piano and sing.
