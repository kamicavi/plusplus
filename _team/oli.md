Hi! I'm Oli and I'm Head of Partnerships at CodeBase, which is a technology incubator based in Scotland. I'm interested in startups and communities, and the area where the two meet. 

In my spare time I enjoy baking bread, walking my elderly staffie called Daisy, and playing around with NoCode tools to build fun apps.
