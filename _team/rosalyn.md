I am a final year PhD student in the Particle Physics Theory department at the University of Edinburgh.  I'm a member of the Neural Network Parton Distribution Functions (NNPDF) collaboration, who use machine learning techniques to find out about what's going on inside protons. 

In my spare time I dance with the Edinburgh Bhangra Crew and love reading and going on walks to explore Edinburgh.
