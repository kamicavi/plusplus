Create a game in 3D in Unity! Think about the object of the game — will there be a scoring system? How do you “win”? Your 3D world can be as simple or as detailed as you wish.

You could aim to include elements such as an objective and at least two of these elements: character, dialogue, collectable item, environment

## Example projects
An Augmented Reality game, for example Pokemon GO.
