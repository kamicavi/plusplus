Create a tool that will tell you about the weather using a weather API (or your own Arduino weather station)

## Example projects
Get access to a weather API to display information. Hereâ€™s an example: <a href="https://www.taps-aff.co.uk/" rel="noopener">https://www.taps-aff.co.uk/</a>

You could also make your own weather station to gather data about the weather.
