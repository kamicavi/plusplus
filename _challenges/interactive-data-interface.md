Rather than just displaying data, make it possible for the user to interact with a substantial dataset. For example, this could involve using a control to alter the view on the data; filtering what is displayed by one or more features; overlaying datasets; or adding, deleting or modifying data.

## Example projects
* A map showing animal migrations which can be updated according to the time of year. 
* A web page that takes in a postcode and displays the location of restaurants within a certain distance of that postcode.
