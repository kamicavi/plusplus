Title: Interactive data interface
---
Rather than just displaying data, make it possible for the user to interact with it. This could involve search, using a control to alter the view, filtering by some feature, or even adding new data.

## Example projects
A map showing animal migrations which can be updated according to the time of year. 
A web page that takes in a postcode and displays the location of restaurants within a certain distance of that postcode.
See the COVID-19 data dashboard for some more ideas.
