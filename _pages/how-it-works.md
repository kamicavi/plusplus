## Overview
The Emporium of Digital Delights starts on 17 May 2021. There will be three Sprints, each of which will last 12 days. You can participate in any one of them, or any two, or all three. 

After all the Sprints are completed, the Emporium will launch a digital showcase, where you can show off your project to friends, family and the world at large.

Here's a picture of how the Emporium of Digital Delights will be organised.

So, for example, you can start with Sprint 1 on 17 May and develop a project in your team over the following two weeks. At that point, you can stop there or carry on to join Sprint 2. Whether or not you carry on, you can still exhibit your work in the Emporium Showcase that will launch in the week of 19 July. Equally, you can just join the Emporium with Sprint 2 or Sprint 3.

## Sprint Schedule

Each of the three Sprints will follow the same 2-week schedule. Here is a provisional look at how the days will be organised.

## Challenges and Badges

In the coming weeks, we will start to flesh out a set of **challenges** that will help you shape the projects you work on during the Sprints. We will have challenges for all levels of experience, divided into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.

In addition, we will be awarding **Open Badges** as a way of recognising what you achieve during your participation in the Emporium of Digital Delights.

More details will follow soon.
