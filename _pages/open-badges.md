## What are Open Badges?

[Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/) are a kind of digital certificate. They are called **open** because there is an open standard for specifying how badges work, both in terms of the external 'view' and the digital innards which stores data about the badge: who issued it, who was awarded it, what achievement it represents, why it was awarded, and so on.

When you are awarded an Open Badge, you can access the badge information via a URL and you can share the link with anyone you want, for example if you are applying for a job or an educational opportunity. You can also combine your badges into a [backpack](https://support.badgr.com/en/knowledge/using-the-badgr-backpack) (digital badge portfolio) that captures your unique combination of interests, skills and achievements.

## Why is Prewired++ awarding Open Badges?

First off, we think Open Badges are cool ðŸ˜€. But more importantly, we think they are a great way to give recognition to your participation and achievements in The Emporium of Digital Delights. Some badges will focus on  technical aspects of your project work and these are listed in the details of [challenges]({{ "/challenges/" | absolute_url }}).

However, we will also be awarding badges to recognise skills such as teamwork, project planning and documenting your code.
