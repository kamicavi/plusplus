## What are Open Badges?

[Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/) are a kind of digital certificate. They are called **open** because there is an open standard for specifying how badges work, both in terms of the external 'view' and the digital innards which stores data about the badge: who issued it, who was awarded it, what achievement it represents, why it was awarded, and so on.

When you are awarded an Open Badge, you can access the information via a URL and you can share the link with anyone you want, for example if you are applying for a job or an educational opportunity. You can also combine your badges into a portfolio that captures your interests, skills and achievements.
