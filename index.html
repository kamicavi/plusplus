The Emporium of Digital Delights starts on <b>17 May 2021</b>  📆😺🎉. It will consist of a series of three Sprints (or
hackathons), each of which will last 12 days. You can participate in any one of
them, or any two, or all three. After all the Sprints are completed,  the Emporium will 
launch a digital showcase, where you can show off your project to
friends 🥳, family 🏠 and the world at large 🌍.
