The Emporium of Digital Delights starts on 17 May 2021 and will consist of a series of three Sprints (or
hackathons), each of which will last 12 days. You can participate in any one of
them, or any two, or all three. After all the Sprints are completed,  the Emporium will 
launch a digital showcase, where you can show off your project to
friends, family and the world at large.
